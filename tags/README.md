Photo tags management

These scripts allow to handle some simple tag modification on photos straight from Nautilus.
I've written these script to sort, tag and order easily my holiday photos.

With these scripts you can :
  * Update main tags (date, title, description, city, country, keyword and author)
  * Rename file according to its creation date, country and city tags
  * Select a time shift and apply it to creation date tag
  * Set filesystem date according to creation date tag
  
All these operations can be done on a specific photo or a groupe of photos.
